## Instructions

This project is part of the Front End Web Developer course, provided by Udacity and Google. As FEND student, I've been provided with a starter project, the starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game. My task was to make it interactive and responsive.

## Usage

To play this game you can either clone this repo on your machine and open index.html file OR just [click this](https://1bugivugi.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/) 

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

## Future Updates

There's a lot to be added, like difficulty levels, adding hero avatar selection and so on! Inc in a few months!(at most) :)
